/**
 * Performance session domain.
 *
 * A session (场次) is an event-sourced-looking aggregate kept in memory:
 *   id        - server assigned, stable for the life of the session
 *   name      - stage-manager supplied label
 *   status    - pending -> running <-> paused -> ended
 *   version   - optimistic-concurrency token, starts at 1, +1 per commit
 *   requestId - id of the last command that was committed to the session
 *   cues      - ordered int32 cues registered while the session is running
 *
 * Every command passes through two serialisation points:
 *
 *   1. a *request-id chain*, global across the whole service. A given
 *      requestId is adjudicated by at most one command at a time, so the
 *      "already committed?" check and the commit cannot interleave between
 *      two sessions (or between a create and a command on an existing
 *      session). This is what makes the deduplication promise global:
 *      one requestId maps to at most one successful commit for the entire
 *      life of the service, regardless of the target session.
 *
 *   2. the *session chain* (a CREATE chain plus one chain per session id),
 *      held for the duration of the request-id slot: validation,
 *      precondition checks and the state mutation happen in one
 *      synchronous critical section, so each command is either committed
 *      exactly once or rejected with the stored data and version
 *      untouched.
 *
 * Commands with different request ids never share a request-id slot, so
 * commands against different sessions still proceed in parallel; only the
 * per-session ordering (and equal-id contenders) are serialised.
